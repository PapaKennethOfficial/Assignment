Authentication Code

Overview

This authentication code is designed to verify the identity of users attempting to access a secure system. It generates a unique code based on a user's credentials and ensures that only authorized users can access the system.

How it Works

1. User attempts to log in to the secure system
2. System prompts user for username and password
3. User enters username and password
4. System generates an authentication code based on user credentials
5. User enters authentication code
6. System verifies authentication code
7. If code is valid, user is granted access to the system

Features

- Generates unique authentication codes for each user
- Verifies user credentials before granting access
- Ensures only authorized users can access the system
- Easy to integrate with existing login systems

Troubleshooting

- If user is unable to log in, check username and password credentials
